Its main purpose is to create a publicly accessible wallpaper gallery where users can upload and download images according to their preferences. Emphasis was placed on ensuring the application is fully responsive and functions seamlessly across different devices.


- The primary goal of this project was to acquire practical knowledge in utilizing the HTML5 drag & drop API and FormData API within the WEB API. Additionally, the project aimed to implement jQuery AJAX requests for interacting with the back end and sending multipart body data.
